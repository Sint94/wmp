### Bind Mini Programs to a WeChat Open Platform account

After a Mini Program has been bound to a WeChat Open Platform account, it can reach other mobile applications, website applications and official accounts under the account, and use a UnionID mechanism to meet the requirements of unified user accounts between multiple applications and official accounts.

**Explanation of UnionID mechanism**: If a developer possesses multiple mobile applications, website applications and official accounts (including Mini Programs), they can use a UnionID to differentiate the uniqueness of users. This is because a user’s UnionID is unique, as long as the mobile applications, website applications or official accounts (including Mini Programs) are under the same WeChat Open Platform account. In other words, a user will have the same UnionID for different applications under the same WeChat Open Platform account. A user’s UnionID can be obtained by calling the Get User Information interface.

Please view Development Documentation—API—Open Interface—User Information to learn about the Get User Information interface.

**Directions on the process for binding Mini Programs:** Log in to the WeChat Open Platform [open.weixin.qq.com](https://open.weixin.qq.com/)—Administration Center—Official Accounts—Bind Official Accounts
