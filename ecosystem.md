## Categories of players

Essentially we have divided the ecosystem in 8:

- (1) the ‘stores’ indexing mini programs,
- (2) the SaaS (Software as a Service) allowing to generate a mini program,
- (3) the service providers building custom code,
- (4) the BaaS (Back-end as a Service) offering a simple solution to Mini Program developers,
- (5) the analytics tools
- (6) the specialized news platforms
- (7) the discussion boards
- (8) the development toolkits

## Some highlights

Platforms like [xcx.9.cn](http://xcx.9.cn/news) and [xudoodoo.com](http://www.xudoodoo.com/) are already combining stores + news + forums + generators + service… trying to capture the traffic and become the dominant hub! Let’s watch them closely in 2018.

[Aladdin](https://www.aldwx.com/), a leading Mini Program analytics tool, was the first Mini Program startup to raise capital (10M USD in June 2018). Just like their competitor [TalkingData](https://www.talkingdata.com/weApp/weApp.jsp), their data collect allows to produce reports on Mini Programs trends, demographics and behaviors! Good for us, since Tencent has been quite shy on official data…
